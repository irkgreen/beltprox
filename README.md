things to do:

add New and Upload buttons
New - asks for ID, date, time, user, comments, unhides the data collection adds an end and pause button, starts timer
Upload - grabs all currently cached data and emails it as csv

Store data on button click to local storage

figure out what to do with undo buttons (right now there is only one per row)
