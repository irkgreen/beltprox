things to do:

New - starts timer, shows countdown on table?

add Upload button
Upload - grabs all currently cached data and emails it as csv

check for “QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR”
-There is a 5MB limit
-should be okay for several data collections (let's do math)

There is a SQLLite version of localstorage but I am unsure of its support

add note to comments if user edits or stops early or edits a database - make uneditable?

test app cache

consider switching completely to jquery (need to use name or change name to ID to use hashtag refs)

consider using json mappings instead of CSV

warn if increment becomes negative?

not sure how to remove old site from the dropdown if the user saves site

clean up, make buttons bigger, line up titles and driver, passenger etc.

make look iOS-ey

make sound on click (buffering)

form not populating on edit on iOS in chrom but okay in safari?

what if you close before save?

<link rel="apple-touch-startup-image" href="/startup.png">

hide title bar

create two buttons for incre/decrem and value
