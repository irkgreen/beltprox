http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html

things to do:

New - starts timer, shows on table

add Upload button
Upload - grabs all currently cached data and emails it as csv

figure out what to do with undo buttons (right now there is only one per row)
-they are in the IncremBtn class too (might need to change)

check for “QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR”
-There is a 5MB limit
-should be okay for several data collections (let's do math)

There is a SQLLite version of localstorage but I am unsure of its support

create a list of sites already saved to the device.  have a button to open its data up in the data collector

add note to comments if user edits or stops early - uneditable?

figure out how to use my own JS refs (not from ajax.aspnetcdn.com)

consider switching completely to jquery

consider using json mappings instead of CSV
