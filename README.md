things to do:

New - starts timer, shows countdown on table?

check for “QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR”
-There is a 5MB limit
-should be okay for several data collections (let's do math)

There is a SQLLite version of localstorage but I am unsure of its support

add note to comments if user edits or stops early or edits a database - make uneditable?

test app cache
-I had to refresh website on my iPhone that was connected to wi-fi in order to get the latest version.  It was using cached.

consider switching completely to jquery (need to use name or change name to ID to use hashtag refs)

consider using json mappings instead of CSV

warn if increment becomes negative?

not sure how to remove old site from the dropdown if the user saves site
-redesign
user cannot change ID or name unless new???  re do new and save site
-maybe have a start button and edit data

clean up, make buttons bigger, line up titles and driver, passenger etc.
make look iOS-ey

make sound on click (buffering) or clean up background color event (buggy)

form not populating on edit on iOS in chrome but okay in safari?

what if you close before save?

<link rel="apple-touch-startup-image" href="/startup.png">
hide title bar

create two buttons for incre/decrem and value

check if date and comment have a comma!

need to remove motorcycle/bike unknowns in local storage or export

change date to number

title row for CSV is set in two places

email not sent on desktop (check and use another method?)

what if no data and upload clicked?
